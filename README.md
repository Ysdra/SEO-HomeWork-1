# SEO-HomeWork-1

## Description 
An example of how to consolidate, simplify, and add semantic elements to an existing HTML codebase to make future collaborations easier.

## HTML Methodology
The changes here were to add HTML semantic tags to make it easier for other devlopers to keep track of the different HTML sections and to delete unnecessary unique classes that were redundant. 

## CSS Methodology 
Streamlining of the CSS elements was accomplished by deleting redundant unique classes in the HTML codebase and replacing them with generic catch-all classes that were re-usable. Additionally, comments were added to the CSS style sheet for future developers to get context and insight into which CSS elements correspond to their respective HTML elements.
